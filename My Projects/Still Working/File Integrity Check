<# Going to work through creating a hash reference file to later use to check file integrity. 
    Task I plan to work through/accomplish:
    - Create hash file reference point
    - Check file hash/integrity script
    - Create csv file that will contain protected (simulated) data
    - Run script at the beginning to create file hash, make changes, and rerun hash check to verify that it has change. #>

#Declare variable to file location and hash creatiion

$fileLocation = "C:\GitHubRepositories\PowerShell\FileHash.txt"
$integrityChk = Get-FileHash -Pa

#Hash File Reference
